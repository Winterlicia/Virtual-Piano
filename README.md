  This project includes a simple Virtual Piano in JS/HTML/CSS where you can play a virtual piano no matter where you go!

## How it Works
- Uses AudioContext (JS Web Audio API) to decode a list of mp3 files of notes
- Decoded audio is then buffered and stored into an array of notes that is called, playing the note sound whenever it's respective key is pressed in the frontend
- HTML/CSS used to design the piano itself with ActionListeners assigned to each key
